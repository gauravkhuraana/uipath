# MobileTestingProject1

This project was developed during a Hackathon organized by **The Test Tribe** on **26â€“27 April 2025**.

## Project Overview
This automation project is built using **UiPath** to perform end-to-end mobile testing on a **SauceLabs sample app**.  
The app allows users to log in, order products, and verify footer information.  
All automation test cases are structured for clarity and maintainability, with a focus on reusable components.
